Day 1: Introduction to Vue.js and Setup
- Lesson (1 hour):
  - What is Vue.js? Overview of its features (reactive data binding, component-based architecture).
  - Comparison with other frameworks (React, Angular).
  - Setting up a Vue.js project using Vue CLI or CDN.
  - Creating your first Vue app: new Vue({ el: '#app', data: { message: 'Hello Vue!' } }).
